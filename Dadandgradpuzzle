Use C1 to determine Stephanie is one of the kids.
Use C2 to determine that Elias and James are the two other kids.
The three graduates are therefore Stephanie, Elias, and James; the three parents must be Michael, Ken, and Alberto.
If Stephanie is not Michael’s child (C1) and Elias is not Michael’s child (C3), then James is Michael’s child.
Either James or Elias is Alberto’s child in C2; since we established James is Michael’s child, Elias must be Alberto’s child.
This leaves Stephanie to be Ken’s child by elimination.Answer (father, child): (Michael, James) (Alberto, Elias) (Ken, Stephanie)
